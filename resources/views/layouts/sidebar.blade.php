        <ul list-style-type: square;>
        <li>The number to be guessed must be a 4 digit number, 
            using only digits from 1 - 9, each digit atmost once. e.g. 1234 is valid, 0123 is not valid, 
            9877 is not valid, 9876 is valid.
        </li>                
        <li>For every guess that the player makes, 
            he gets 2 values - the number of bulls and the number of cows.
            1 bull means the guess contains and the target number have 1 digit in common, and in the correct position. 
            1 cow means the guess and the target have 1 digit in common,
            but not in correct position. e.g. Let the target be 1234. 
            Guessing 4321 will give 0 bulls and 4 cows. 3241 will give 1 bull and 3 cows. 
            4 bulls means you have won the game!
